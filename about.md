I am Tejan Karmali, 2nd year graduate student at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.
I am a passionate programmer. I am interested in Deep Learning. In my free time, I like reading
about Deep Learning related news and articles.

My research interest lies in representation learning from the perspective of 3D and generalization.
